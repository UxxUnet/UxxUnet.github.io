Building a blog has always been a dream of mine. Recording every bit of growth and knowledgy newly learnt makes me feel good. Thus I open this blog.

## Introduction
Among all the way to build a personal lightweight static blog, building on github is one of the quikest and easiest way for amateur, in my perspective. In this blog, I'm going to inctroduce the way I learnt to build a blog by Jekyll on github. For the Github part, the best and clearest tutotial I learnt from is from [qiubaiying](https://github.com/qiubaiying/qiubaiying.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2017-02-06-%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2.md), in Chinese though. Again, it's for program amateurs and you can have your own blog page within 1 minus.

If you still don't believe, enter `yourusername.github.io` in your address bar of your browser.

Of cause, it still looks the same with mine but just a little more settings it will turn to yours completely.

Open your repository in your github page and find the _config.yml file. Open it.

Find the files named yourusername.github.io and the blogs are saved in the folder _posts. Delete all the files in it and start to create your own.
