## Original

The University of Waymarsh surveyed to find out that the Waymarsh citizens prefer the literary classics while they found the mystery novel is the hottest book in the library. Based on this, they concluded that the respondents lied. However, there're some important factors they haven't take into consideration, which might lead to the wrong conclusion.  

First of all, the second study does not necessarily mean that the Waymarsh citizens prefer the mystery novel. For instance, reading frequency and reading time can make a difference. As we all can estimate, mystery novels may be relatively shorter and cost less time compared to classics which leads to a higher reading frequency recorded in the library, so as the reading time. Thus the point here is that the higher check-out frequency in the library does not necessarily mean better perference of the book due to characters of different books. In addition, reading places counts since not everyone joint the survey perfer to borrow book from public libraries. As is often the case, people prefer to buy the literary classics to read for their collection value but they don't buy mystery novel and perfer to borrow because they just read them for one time. That means different behaviors towards various books can also contribute to the higher check-out frequency. Thus, there're plenty of alternative explanations for the higher check-out frequency of mystery novel, rendering that the second study cannot confidently infer that the Waymarsh citizens prefer the mystery novel.

Another important factor is that the researchers fail to notice the difference between the readers in the public libraries and the respondents of the first study when they put them together to draw conclutions. Taking age distribution as an example, it sounds an alternative explanation to me that teenagers who go to public libraries prefer mystery novels while most middle-aged people who perfer classsics took the survey they conducted. Of course, one cannot expect the same reading habits from two group of people when they come from different age groups. Therefore, two conclusions cannot place together to draw conclusion for the factors loosely controlled.  

To sum up, according to reasons above, the researchers fail to notice the likely explanations of the seccond study and fail to control all the factors of two studies thus lead to a wrong conlusion in the end.

## Revision

### First paragraph

The University of Waymarsh surveyed to find out that the Waymarsh citizens prefer the literary classics while they found the mystery novel is the hottest book in the library. Based on this, they concluded that the respondents lied. However, there're some important factors they haven't take into consideration, which might       ~~lead to the wrong conclusion~~ render their conclusion wrong.  


### Second paragraph


First of all, the second study does not necessarily mean that the Waymarsh citizens prefer **(reading)** the mystery novel. For instance, reading frequency and reading time **(of different book)**can make a difference. ~~As we all can estimate, mystery novels may be relatively shorter and cost less time compared to classics which leads to a higher reading frequency recorded in the library, so as the reading time.~~

As we all can estimate, mystery novels, **comparesd to classics**, might be relatively shorter and cost less time to read, thus leading to **more records of checking in and out in the public libraries**.

Thus the point here is that the higher check-out frequency in the library does not necessarily mean better perference of the book due to characters of different books. 

**(For example, reading five mystery novels takes only two days while reading one classics takes a month.)** That means the Waymarsh citizens checkout the mystery novel more not because they prefer reading mystery novels, maybe just because  reading mystery novels is quicker. Consequently, the second study 

### Third paragraph

In addition, reading places counts since not everyone joint the survey perfer to borrow book from public libraries. 

Even ignore the reading time, 


As is often the case, people prefer to buy the literary classics to read for their collection value but they don't buy mystery novel and perfer to borrow because they just read them for one time. That means different behaviors towards various books can also contribute to the higher check-out frequency. Thus, there're plenty of alternative explanations for the higher check-out frequency of mystery novel, rendering that the second study cannot confidently infer that the Waymarsh citizens prefer the mystery novel.
